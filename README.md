#HarbergerLicenseTrust

A decentralized system for administering ERC721 Harberger licenses attaching to real-world assets.

1. Draw up a real-world contract entitling the holder of a particular ERC721 token to a Harberger license on an asset.

2. Mint an ERC721 token corresponding to a Harberger license on a real asset.  Set the turnover rate (i.e., the ongoing fees to hold the license), the value of the Harberger license, and the beneficiary of the fees.

3. As often as desired, the token holder may update her self-assessed license value, thus changing the fees she must pay to hold it.

4. When fees are not paid, equity in the Harberger license equal to the amount of the unpaid fees reverts to the contract.  It may be bought back by paying back-fees.

5. Anyone may transfer any Harberger license token to himself by paying its self-assessed value to the contract, which then forwards that amount to the former holder.
